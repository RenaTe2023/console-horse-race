Challenge: C# programming, OOP

In this console horse race, two horses compete against each other. 

The horse and jockey teams are initially determined using random generators; 
the player can then bet on a team. 

During the race, a value for the horse's current speed is determined in a random generator 
and the race can be followed live in a simple graphical display. 

At the end, the winning team is determined and the average speed of the two horses is calculated and displayed.
